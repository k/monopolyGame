Monopoly Java
============

A Java Monopoly Game made for a final project my junior year of high school.  This was my first full programming project EVER.
I really enjoyed making it and its where my journey into computer science really started.  
Unfortunately I cant find my final version of the game, which had implemented trading and some other game logistics, but 
this includes the game logic and all the classes for objects in the game like cards, properties, etc.
